## Expansion Guidelines

### Adding New Features

Each module is designed to be easily extensible:

1. **Network Scanner**: Add new scanning techniques, vulnerability checks, or output formats
2. **Log Analyzer**: Add new log parsers, detection rules, or analysis algorithms
3. **File Encryptor**: Add new encryption algorithms, key management features, or security enhancements

### Development Best Practices

- Follow the existing code structure and patterns
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include user input validation
- Update help documentation when adding features
- Test thoroughly before deployment

### Security Considerations

- Always validate user inputs
- Use secure random number generation for keys
- Implement proper error handling to avoid information disclosure
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular security audits and updates
